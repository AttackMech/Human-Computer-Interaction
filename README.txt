Human Computer Interaction

This course is designed to have students learn how to design user interfaces based on human-computer interaction (HCI) concepts. A final project is developed over 3 assignments that are presented here. In my case, I developed an interface for a video game console. The first assignment is the requirements and prototyping phase. The second assigment is to get practice evealuating a piece of software, in my case I evaluated the Microsoft Edge browser, since it was new with Windows 10.

The final assignment is to create and evaluate the actual software. The final assigment is to create and evaluate the actual interface. As mentioned, I created a video game console interface. The user uses the game controller to control the actions on screen and navigate the interface. The user can turn on the console, open and close the tray, and insert a game or movie disc into the console. All other actions take place on the interface screen.

*Note: To run the final software, you will need the Allegro software, available from http://www.allegrosoft.com/. I have included the Allegro files I used, placed directly under the C:\ directory.
